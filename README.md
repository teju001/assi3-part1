Part 1 (OOP Programming - JAVA - Inheritance Design Lab):
In this section, we downloaded the inheritance lab pdf from the portal and used eclipse to create a parent class HospitalEmployee with two protected instance variables: Integer number and string name 
We created the subclasses Nurse and Doctor, each of which has the inherited variables, as well as a new instance variable for specialty and a new variable numOfPatients. For these two classes, we also implemented a constructor and overrode the toString method. 
Then I created a Surgeon class with a new instance called variable operating that indicates whether the surgeon is currently operating or not, as well as a constructor and toString method for the Surgeon class.
Then,I ran the code without the work functionÂ  
then with the work function and recorded the output.
